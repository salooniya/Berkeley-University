                <p class="text" style="color: #003262;"> <span style="font-size: 4vw; color: #003262;">I</span>n 1912, the
                    university came under intense pressure from the people of southern California to create a new, rival
                    institution. To answer the calls, but without wanting to concede to creating a new university all
                    together, the university's president, Benjamin Ide Wheeler recruited Ira Woods Howerth from the
                    University of Chicago to create a strong Extension presence in the southern parts of the state. It
                    turned out that Howerth was even more of an idealist than Stephens and openly stated his vision for
                    Extension to serve the people of the state in the ways they wanted and needed to be served,
                    irrespective of University ideals.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To achieve this objective, he designed a trailblazing organizational structure and implemented
                    visionary new departments: Beyond the original class instruction, he revived the popular public
                    lectures and added entertainment to them, he created departments for debate and public discussion as
                    well as information and social welfare. To reach even more people, he pioneered correspondence
                    instruction and allocated an entire department to it which served up to 5,500 students in 1917.
                    Extension also began working with other institutions in offering classes to specific audiences whose
                    need for education was particularly telling-for instance, the inmates at San Quentin and Folsom
                    prisons.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1915, Extension ventured into new forms of education and set up the Department of Visual
                    Instruction to exploit the new motion picture technology for educational purposes. Howerth was an
                    idealistic visionary clearly ahead of his time, and as such the university implemented regulatory
                    bodies that govern Extension until today, including the Academic Senate Committees on Extension
                    (1912) and Courses of Instruction (1913). In 1917 Extension began offering courses in Los Angeles a
                    full two years before the university finally gave in to the calls of the public and in 1917
                    established its second campus, UCLA.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By the time Howerth was let go from the university while serving in World War I in 1918, he had
                    managed to establish Extension as the fundamental institution and model of the higher and continuing
                    education it is today in California and around the world. At the end of the first world war,
                    California experienced an economic boom accompanied by a dramatic increase of population, which
                    meant that suddenly there was a greater need, and more money available, for education to offer its
                    basic academic curriculum, Extension began providing vocational and training courses to thousands of
                    veterans and to others eager to compete in new industrial markets.

                    Professor Leon Richardson served as Director of Extension and reintroduced the ideals of Liberal
                    Arts education into the educational standards and offerings, and recruited standard faculty again.
                    His humanistic vision for Extension was that of lifelong learning', a term for which is widely
                    credited, and which made Extension a national model and him a leading figure in Continuing
                    Education. In 1923, in collaboration with the American Federation of Labor, Extension launched the
                    Workers' Education Bureau of America, which offered courses in economics, public speaking, and labor
                    problems and history. Despite the fact that many faculty were reluctant to lecture to ordinary adult
                    learners, notably in mission-driven programs targeted at workers, Extension grew rapidly and by
                    1924, ranked second in the country in the number of continuing education courses offered by an
                    institution of higher education.
